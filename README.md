## Hi there 👋
I'm Gul Muhammad, a BSc Computer science student at Soton, and currently in my penultimate year of my degree (how time flies)! I always look for opportunities to learn, even if it means falling flat on my face multiple times, but applying those lessons to something that is truly meaningfull as well as feasible. I'm currently learning more on computation, functional programming, AI and machine learning frameworks and pipelines, and the impact of modern AI on the human condition. In my free time, I enjoy singing and discovering new music, as well as learning about history, whether it's prehistoric, medieval, or modern history of the 20th century.
